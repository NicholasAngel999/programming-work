# Help Sheet to help me not forget about Python

**Snake case** = each_word_seperated_by _ 
**Pascal Case** = Each Word Starts With A Capital
**Camal Case** = each Word But The First Is Capital


fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

print(x) will return apple etc

## spaces 
x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)

*if there was no space after "Python " or "is " then the print would return Pythonisawesome instead of python is awesome
